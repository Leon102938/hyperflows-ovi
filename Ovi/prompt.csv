"A high-end stylized 3D animated bedroom set, wide-angle camera from the foot of the bed, clean modern interior, warm morning light through a large window, soft plastic-like materials and smooth cinematic shading. The bed is made entirely of crispy bacon strips layered like a quilted mattress, with bacon pillows and a bacon blanket, slightly glossy with tiny grease highlights. A character enters frame, sits on the edge of the bed, then gently pulls the bacon blanket up over their legs; the blanket bends naturally and jiggles softly. Smooth camera dolly-in, stable geometry, no flicker, no warping, consistent lighting, shallow depth of field. Audio: soft cloth rustle, subtle bacon crackle, quiet footsteps on wooden floor, gentle room tone."
